# Hi, I'm Saikiran 👋

I’m a Software Engineer focused on building practical backend and data-driven systems with Python. I enjoy shipping clean, reliable features and learning full-stack development.

## What I’m working on
- Python backend services (FastAPI/Flask), SQL, Docker, AWS fundamentals
- Data pipelines and processing (PySpark)
- Computer vision projects (OpenCV)

## Featured Projects
- **Fraud Detection API** — FastAPI ML inference service with validation + Docker  
- **Face Recognition Attendance** — OpenCV + Tkinter + SQLite desktop app (enroll → train → mark)  
- **Distributed Data Processing** — PySpark ETL pipeline (ingest → validate → transform → load → Parquet)
